        <b>Golf</b> is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.
      </p>
      <p>Golf, unlike most <a href="/wiki/Ball_game" class="mw-redirect" title="Ball game">ball games</a>, cannot and does not
        use a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of
        the game. Courses typically have either 18 or 9 <a href="/wiki/Glossary_of_golf#Hole"
          title="Glossary of golf"><i>holes</i></a>, regions of terrain that each contain a <i>cup</i>, the hole that receives
        the ball. Each hole on a course contains a <a href="/wiki/Teeing_ground" title="Teeing ground">teeing ground</a> to
        start from, and a <a href="/wiki/Putting_green" class="mw-redirect" title="Putting green">putting green</a> containing
        the cup. There are several standard forms of terrain between the tee and the green, such as the fairway, rough (tall
        grass), and various <a href="/wiki/Hazard_(golf)" title="Hazard (golf)"><i>hazards</i></a> such as water, rocks, or
        sand-filled <a href="/wiki/Glossary_of_golf#Bunker" title="Glossary of golf"><i>bunkers</i></a>. Each hole on a course
        is unique in its specific layout.
      </p>
      <p>Golf is played for the lowest number of strokes by an individual, known as <a href="/wiki/Stroke_play"
          title="Stroke play">stroke play</a>, or the lowest score on the most individual holes in a complete round by an
        individual or team, known as <a href="/wiki/Match_play" title="Match play">match play</a>. Stroke play is the most
        commonly seen format at all levels, especially at the elite level.

      <p>The modern game of golf <a href="/wiki/Golf_in_Scotland" title="Golf in Scotland">originated in 15th century

        Origin and History
      </h2>
      <p>While the modern game of golf originated in 15th century <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>, the game's ancient origins are unclear and much debated.
      </p>
      <p>Some historians<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> trace the sport back to the Roman game of <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/paganica" class="extiw" title="wikt:paganica">paganica</a>, in which participants used a bent stick to hit a stuffed leather ball. One theory asserts that paganica spread throughout Europe as the Romans conquered most of the continent, during the first century BC, and eventually evolved into the modern game.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>
